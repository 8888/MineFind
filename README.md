# Features
This is a full-featured Minesweeper clone with 3 difficulties. The player can open spaces, flag known mines, and clear multiple spaces at once.

# Controls
-Left mouse click to open a space<br>
-Right mouse click to flag a space<br>
-Left and right click simultaneously on a cleared space shows potential spaces and opens spaces if all adjacent mines are flagged

# Design
This uses HTML5 canvas to draw all of the display elements. There are no artwork resources, as the entire display, mines, flags, and gameplay is drawn using lines and arcs on the canvas. The game logic is javascript and allows quick integration with the display.

*Disclaimer:*
This is a clone. I did not design the original look or idea of this game, nor do I claim to have.
